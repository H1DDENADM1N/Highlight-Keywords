After transcribing long text, if there is a keyword in the text, it can be displayed in red, such as " `focus` ", " `attention` ", and other keywords, I hope to be able to highlight in the transcribed text, not the same color, or there is a mark in front of the word, as long as there is a logo on the line! I hope it can be highlighted in the transcribed text in a different color or with a mark in front of the word, as long as there is a logo. I need it very much.
